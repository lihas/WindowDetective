      <h3><a name="cursor"></a>Cursor</h3>
      <p>The "window picker" cursor can use 32-bit colour with transparency on
      operating systems that support it (Window XP and higher). Alternatively,
      you can choose to use a 16-bit indexed colour cursor.</p>
      <h3><a name="regex"></a>Regular Expression Syntax</h3>
      <p>When matching a regular expression, such as in the Find dialog,
      Window Detective will use one of the following syntax:
      <table class="optionlist">
        <tr>
        <td class="option">Standard RegExp</td>
        <td>A rich Perl-like pattern matching syntax.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td class="option">Wildcard</td>
        <td>This provides a simple pattern matching syntax similar to that used by
        shells (command interpreters) for "file globbing".<br />
        Wildcard matching is much simpler than full regexps and has only four features:
        <table class="normal" style="border-collapse: collapse;">
          <tr>
          <td>c</td>
          <td>Any character represents itself apart from those mentioned below.
          Thus c matches the character c.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>?</td>
          <td>Matches any single character. It is the same as . in full regexps.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>*</td>
          <td>Matches zero or more of any characters. It is the same as .* in full regexps.</td>
          <tr>
          <td>[...]</td>
          <td>Sets of characters can be represented in square brackets, similar
          to full regexps. Within the character class, like outside, backslash
          has no special meaning.</td>
          </tr>
        </table></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td class="option">Wildcard Unix</td>
        <td>This is similar to Wildcard but with the behaviour of a Unix shell. The
        wildcard characters can be escaped with the character "".</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

        <p class="option">Keep Window Detective windows on top</p>
        <p>The Window Detective main window, and any other dialog windows such as
        the Find dialog, will stay on top of other windows on the desktop.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> When this option is changed, the application needs
        to re-build the affected windows, so you may notice them disappear for a short
        period of time.</p>
