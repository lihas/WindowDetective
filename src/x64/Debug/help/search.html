      <h2>Searching for a Window</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <p>If you cannot locate a window in the tree or on screen, you can search
      for it using the find dialog. To open the find dialog, click the find icon
      <img class="icon" src="images/icons/find.png"/> or press Ctrl+F.</p>
      <p>There are two ways to search: basic, where you can search for a window either
      by it's text/title, handle or class; and advanced, where you can specify multiple
      criteria to search by.</p>
      <h3>Basic search</h3>
      <p>Using the basic tab, you can search for a window using one of a few simple
      criteria.</p>

      </div>
      <table class="optionlist">
        <tr><td class="option">Text</td>
        <td>A string or sub-string to search for in the window's text (if it is a
        top-level window, this will be it's title).<br />
        Tick the "Case Sensitive" check box to search matching the case.<br />
        Tick the "Regular Expresion" check box to use regular expression matching.<br />
        The type of regex syntax used depends on the settings, see
        <a href="./preferences_general.html#regex">Regex Preference</a>
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td class="option">Handle</td>
        <td>The HWND handle of the window to search for.
        This can be either an integer in base 10 (decimal) or base 16 (hexadecimal).
        </td><tr>
        <tr><td class="option">Class</td>
        <td>The name of the window's class. The list of all registered classes are
        available in the drop-down list.
        </td></tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Advanced search</h3>
      <p>The advanced tab allows for more specific, detailed searches to be performed. You
      can add any number of search criteria, selecting a property to search for, a comparison
      operator, and a value to compare to.</p>

      <table class="optionlist">
        <tr><td class="option">Property</td>
        <td>Lists all the window properties that can be searched.
        The following properties are available:
        <table><tr><td><ul>
          <li>Text</li>
          <li>Handle</li>
          <li>Window Class</li>
          <li>Styles</li>
          <li>Extended Styles</li>
        </ul></td>
        <td><ul>
          <li>Is Unicode</li>
          <li>Process Name</li>
          <li>Process Id</li>
          <li>Thread Id</li>
        </ul></td></tr></table>
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td class="option">Operator</td>
        <td>For each property, a number of search operators is available. What operators
        are available depend on the type of property (e.g. text, number). Text has
        operators such as "equals", "contains" and "matches" (for regular expressions).
        Numbers have the usual operators, "equals", "less than", etc.
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td class="option">Value to find</td>
        <td>This is the value to search for. As with operators, the acceptable values
        depend on the type of property. The input field will only accept a valid type.
        For windows and window classes, a drop-down list is provided to select from any
        existing object.
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td class="option">Boolean relation</td>
        <td>Each search criteria is combined by a boolean relation - "and"/"or". If
        "and" is selected, both criteria must be true for each window searched. If "or"
        is selected, only one criteria needs to be true. Each relation operates on the
        result of the previous criteria, there is no way to specify order-of-operations.
        That is: <tt>A and B or C</tt> is treated as <tt>((A and B) or C)</tt>.
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td class="option">Add/Remove criteria</td>
        <td>Adds or removes a criteria item. When adding, the new criteria item will
        be added after the one where the add button was pressed.
        </td></tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Performing the search</h3>
      <p>After you have entered the appropriate criteria, click the "Find" button.
      A results dialog will be shown listing all windows found. These windows are
      displayed in a list with columns similar to that in the hierarchy trees.<br />
      You also have the option of repeating the search by clicking the "Repeat
      Search" button on the results pane. This will re-run the search and update
      the list with the new results. This can be useful if some windows were changed
      since you first ran the search.</p>
