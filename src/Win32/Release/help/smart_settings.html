      <p>Window Detective has a unique feature which intelligently remembers
      settings such as window positions and some often-used options. These
      settings are called "Smart Settings".</p>
      <h3>What are Smart Settings?</h3>
      <p>Basically, they are settings that remember the previous value set only
      if that value has been set often in the past. It will remember the most
      frequently used settings and ignore any one-time-only changes to those
      settings.</p>
      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>Each smart setting has a "history", a list of previously set values, as
      well as a current value. Each time a new value is set, it is added to the
      list, and an algorithm determines if that new value should be used as the
      current one or not. The algorithm checks all previous values and if they are
      all equal to the new value, then it becomes the current value. Otherwise the
      old current value is kept (but the new value is still remembered in the
      history).</p>
      <p>The list of previous values has a maximum size of 3. This
      size determines how many times you must use a certain value before it is
      remembered. If this size is too large, Window Detective will only remember
      settings that you use very often. Too small, and it will remeber every
      little change you make.</p>
      <h3>Why are Smart Settings useful?</h3>
      <p>Each time you use Window Detective, you may be using it for different
      purposes or you may be using it for mostly the same purpose.</p>
      <p>Other programs will remember only the last value set for such things as
      window positions and size. This may be fine if you want it to stay that
      way, but often you make a change to these settings that you don't want
      to be permanent.</p>
      <p>For example, say you work with dual monitors - a primary monitor and
      a secondary, possibly smaller, one. When you start a program, you place it's
      window on the primary monitor where you work. But one time you need to move
      it to the second monitor to free up screen space on the first one. The next
      time you open the program you expect to see it open on the first monitor
      where it normally does but instead it opens on the second monitor. This may
      not be a big deal, but it can be quite annoying. This is where smart
      settings come in handy. Window Detective will remember that you like it to
      open on the first monitor, so if you use it on the second monitor one time,
      it will not remember that and will open in it's usual place next time.</p>
