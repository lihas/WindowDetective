      <h2>Translating Window Detective</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Window Detective is built using the <a href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt framework</a>,
      which has built-in support for multiple languages. The text strings in the
      user interface (UI) can be displayed in any language, provided there is a
      translation file present for that language.</p>
      <p>When installing Window Detective, you will be asked to select a
      language. There are a number of languages to choose from and if your
      systems language is one of them it will be selected by default. If your
      language is not included in the installer, you may wish to translate the
      application yourself.</p>
      <h3>How to translate</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><!-- Step 1 -->
        <p>Download the <a href="http://windowdetective.sourceforge.net/files/translations/Translation Pack.zip"><b>translation pack</b></a></p>
        <p>In this zip file you will find a file containing all translatable strings
        in Window Detective as well as the Qt tool (Linguist) which will be used
        to translate the strings. Qt Linguist can be ran as a stand-alone application
        (i.e. it doesn't need to be installed), but it does require the DLLs that
        are included in the zip file.</p>
        <p>Existing translation files are also included. As new versions of
        Window Detective are released, these files may need to be updated.</p>
        </li>
        <li><!-- Step 2 -->
        <p>(Optional) Download the latest
        <a href="http://windowdetective.sourceforge.net/files/Window Detective.zip"><b>source code</b></a></p>
        <p>This step is not necessary, but it will help when using Linguist.
        If you do not wish to download the source code, you may skip to the next
        step. The only disadvantage of not having the source code available is that
        Linguist will not be able to show you what the UI will look like with the
        translated strings. You will still be able to perform the translation.</p>
        <p>If you do download the source code, extract the zip file to where you
        want to work, and look in the \src\translations directory. This directory
        contains any existing translation files (which are also included in the
        Translation Pack) as well as the compiled files (you can ignore them).
        You will need to put your translation file here for Linguist to be able
        to pick up the source location (the .ts file contains relative file paths).</p>
        </li>
        <li><!-- Step 3 -->
        <p>Change the name of the <tt>template.ts</tt> file to <tt>&lt;language&gt;_&lt;country&gt;.ts</tt>.</p>
        <p><tt>&lt;language&gt;</tt> is a lowercase, two-letter, ISO 639 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">language code</a>,
        and <tt>&lt;country&gt;</tt> is an uppercase, two-letter, ISO 3166 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2">country code</a>.</p>
        <p>For example, the Polish translation file is <tt>pl_PL.ts</tt>.
        If you are not sure what codes to choose, just pick the language or country
        closest to yours. This naming scheme is not important, it only serves to provide
        a unique name for each translation.</p>
        </li>
        <li><!-- Step 4 -->
        <p>Start <tt>linguist.exe</tt> and open the .ts file.</p>
        <p>You will be prompted to select the source and target language. The source
        language is obviously English (the country doesn't really matter, but it is
        Australia). The target language and country are the same as those you used
        to name the .ts file.</p>
        <p>Once that is done, you will see the Linguist main window:</p>
        <table>
        <tr><td>
        <div class="screenshot">
          <a href="images/qlinguist.png"><img src="images/qlinguist_small.png" alt="Screenshot of Qt Linguist tool"/></a>
          <p>The Qt Linguist main window (click for a larger image)</p>
        </div>
        </td>
        <td>
        <p>On the far left of the window, there is a list of all classes or UI forms
        that contain translatable text. When an item from that list is selected, the
        second list shows all strings in that class or form.</p>
        <p>The right side shows either the source code or the UI form, depending on
        whether the string is in the source code or a form. Note: If you did not do
        Step 2, this area will be blank or will day that it cannot find the source code.</p>
        <p>Below that is the area to enter the translated text, it's pretty straight-
        forward. You don't have to bother with the comments section unless you want to.</p>
        <p>After you have entered the translation, press Ctrl+Enter to move on to the
        next unfinished one</p>
        </td></tr>
        </table>
        </li>
        <li><!-- Step 5 -->
        <p>Once you have translated all the strings, create a
        <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/windowdetective/translations/">ticket</a>
        and attach the .ts file. I will then compile the file and
        include it in the next release. You can give me your name to include in the
        credits, or i can put your email address or just an alias.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="warn">
        <p><b>Important Note:</b> There are some words or phrases which should not
		be translated, either because they are special words that cannot change,
        or because there is no appropriate translation for them. The following
        words or phrases should be left alone:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The application name, "Window Detective"</li>
          <li>Variable placeholders. Some strings contain a placeholder which, when
          displayed in the UI, will show the value of a variable. This placeholder is
          a percent character (%) followed by a number. e.g. %1, %2</li>
          <li>Ampersand (&amp;) before a character. There are used for standard menu
          accessability, the character following &amp; is used to select that menu item
          using the keyboard. The character will most likely be different in another
          language, so you may have to choose another.</li>
          <li>Punctuation such as full stops or exclamation marks. Linguist will warn
          you if punctuation is incorrect or you forget a % or &amp;.</li>
          <li>Newline (\n) or tab (\t) characters.</li>
          <li>Ctrl key combinations, e.g. Ctrl+F</li>
          <li>Certain technical words like "window" or "handle". These words have a
          number of different meanings in English and most likely do too in any other
          language, but they have a specific meaning here. For instance, "window" refers
          to a graphical UI component - not a pane of glass; and "handle" refers to an
          integer used by the Operating System to itentify a window - not something used
          to open a door.</li>
          <li>Markup tags. For any strings containing HTML, only the "visible" text
          can be translated. That is, text that will be shown in the UI when the HTML
          is rendered. Any text enclosed in angle brackets (<tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>&gt;</tt>)
          must not be translated. The same goes for HTML symbols such as
          <tt>&amp;quot;</tt></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If there are any words or phrases you are not sure of, just leave them as
        they are in English.</p>
