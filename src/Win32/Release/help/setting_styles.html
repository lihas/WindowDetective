      <p>In addition to window properties such as dimensions and text, a window's
      styles can also be modified. All windows have a number of different styles
      which control their look and behaviour. Most of the standard Windows controls
      such as Button and Edit also have specific styles which only apply to them.</p>
      <p>To modify the style of a window, right click on that window in the tree
      and select "Edit Window Styles" to open the "Set Properties" dialog on the
      styles tab. Alternatively, you can select "Set Properties..." then go to
      the styles tab.</p>
